# Image Augmentation Using Albumentations
This Python script reads all images in a given directory and applies various pixel-level transformations from the Albumentations library to them. 
The resulting transformed images are written to a new directory created in the working directory of the script.

## Requirements
The script imports OpenCV and Albumentations, so these must be installed on the host machine to run it. The local directory containing the script must not also contain
a directory sharing the same name as the output folder name given in the script. By default, this is "VisDrone-Robust-set," but this can be changed by editing the variable 
write_directory in img_augmentation.py. The default input folder is "VisDrone2019-DET-val" and must be included in the same directory as this script in order for it to run.
